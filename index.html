    <h2>My interests</h2>

    <p> Howdy! My name is Erina Tejani, and I created this website using GitHub. This is an assignment for my ISTM 310 class for the Fall 2025 Semester. On this particular assignment, I have chosen to talk about my interests/hobbies. </p>
  
    <p> Starting off, some of my academic interests are information systems, consulting, and analysis. I am pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems with a minor in AI. I am currently involved in TASK consulting, which allows real-world experience in the consulting and analysis world. Additionally, I am a member of Delta Sigma Pi, the Association of Information Technology Professionals, and the Business and Consulting Association.  I am super interested in using technology to make the business world better and cannot wait to learn more as I go!  </p>

    <p>Moving into my nonacademic interests, I enjoy dancing, socializing, and service. I grew up doing competitive dance, and I miss it every day. I am also involved in Aggie Southern Darlings, where I get to socialize with others at numerous events. Service is one of our pillars, which allows me to constantly give back to the community. Overall, I am heavily involved while making time for my numerous interests in college. </p>
